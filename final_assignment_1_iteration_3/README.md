I tried different n_features values and noticed that the smaller the n_features is, the better performance for the training set, but worse for the test set. So I changed n_features to 2*18. Iâ€™ve also tried different value of ngram_range. Then I tried changing TfidfVectorizer values, but it didn't work out because I kept getting error messages.  

ngram_range=(1,3)
