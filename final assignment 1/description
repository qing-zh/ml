This is the assignment file for final assignment 1 of Machine Learning class. 

I started with changing the n_features in the process_raw_data function. 
I found that the smaller the n_features is, the better the training set performs, but the perforance is worse for the test set. 
Then I make the n_features value bigger. The performance for each model is better generally. 
However the resul for the best performed model is worse. 

I tried adding a "!" count on the X side of equation, but the result doesn't change a lot. 
Then I changed the ngram_range, and the performance finally improves a little.
