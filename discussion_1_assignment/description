I changed the n_features of HashingVectorizer function from 2**17 to 2**18 because movie reviews is not a huge database, 
so I think the predict result would be more accurate while increasing the number of features. 
The performance of different models are better in general, but the result of the best-performed model is worse, surprisingly.
