I changed the low threshold and high threshold because I think there are too much lines in the pictures, which may leads to confusion. I’ve tried to changed the mode parameter in resize function to “edge”, but the result got worse. According to this attempt, I realized that it might helped to make the picture smooth. Therefore, I’ve tried to use transform.pyramid_reduce to blur the pictures, but I kept getting error messages. So I gave up and changed the anti_aliasing parameters in resize function instead.
