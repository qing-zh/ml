While reviewing the false result, I noticed that some important edges were not detected successfully because the color of the plane and background are too similar, so I was thinking maybe it needs a more accurate input. I tried changing the mode parameter in resize function to “constant”, and change the cval value. And I found out that a higher cval value leads to better performance.
